			<p>
				1.) Visit your D2L page and click on Self Registration. Next scroll down and click Kids First. Then click register.<br>
				2.) You will need 2 background check forms. One you will find under the content section of the Kids First page. The second one
					will be from the state that you were born in. You will also need to bring a copy of your Drivers Licence.<br>
				3.) You will need to complete the online quiz. Both the quiz form and the tutorials are in the materials/content section.
					Review the tutorials, and bring the completed quiz with you.<br>
				4.) Kids First Picture ID: This can be obtained from the Campus Card Office by the Registrar Hub. Pay $3 at the Cashier 
					Office, and then go to the Campus Card Office (Maxwell 227) and tell them you need a photo ID for the Kids First program. 
					Bring the paid slip with you to the Campus Card Office.<br>
				5.) <em>Note: These are child safety issues. You cannot volunteer until all are complete.</em><br>
