			<p>
				1.) Warning:<br>
				The violation is explained and the warning is noted<br>
				2.) Time-Out:<br>
				A 15 minute time-out is given after the 2nd violation.
				For the older kids a time-out is being taken out of the building.
				Children in kindergarten or first grade may be sent to a time-out chair
				by the front desk.<br>
				3.) Dismissal:<br>
				The child is sent home for the night. We want to keep kids in the center
				when possible, so dismissal is used for repeated violation or more serious behavior.
