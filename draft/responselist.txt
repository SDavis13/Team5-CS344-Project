Volunteering at Kids First helped me to develop my teaching skills. 
Kids First provided a great place to hone my teaching skills and experience working with kids in a multicultural environment.
I just had such a great experience! Thank you!
It has been great to know that I am applying skills I learned at Kids First with children in my classroom!
